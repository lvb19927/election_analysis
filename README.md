# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview

Colorado Board of Elections wants an election audit of the recent congressional election. There was a list of criteria necessary to complete this task:
  1. Total number of votes
  2. A complete list of candidates and their votes
  3. Find the total number of votes per candidate
  4. Calculate the percentage of votes won for each candidate
  5. Find the winner based on the number of votes

Using Python, we will create a code that will run and track all of the above.

## Challenge Summary:
 We accumulated a 8 step process in order to deliver a complete election audit to the election commission:
1. Calculating the total votes
2. Retrieve the candidates and their votes
3. Calculate the number of votes per candidate
4. Calculating the percentage of votes per candidate
5. Find the winner based on total number of votes

*On top of all of this*, we modified a few more steps to dive a little deeper into the results:

6. Calculate the amount of votes in each county
7. Calculate the percentage of votes each county contributed to the election
8. and find which county had the most votes
